enhancementalarm_control_panel.py
----------------------
- take into account endity_id from service calls (what to do in MQTT case?)
- check how it works if HA restarts in triggered state (will it resume triggering? _lasttrigger?)
- Enable MQTT without HA restart/(WIP)
- validate MQTT using schema
- state[mode]xxx_time appear in yaml with (when that section edited via Settings) OR without quotes, investigate
- check init of global and state-level pending/warning/trigger_time
- do we need enable_night_mode at all?
- missing: - floorplan
          - custom_panel

Milestones
- remove obsolete enable_perimeter_mode attribute and perimeter_mode stuff from the code
- get rid of doc/notes.md

KNOWN POTENTIAL ISSUES
- arm_xxx with open sensor (override), reboot HA -> will react to open sensor and trigger the alarm
- what if the panel is open in a browser? (can hit Back button and access previous screen/view even if armed)
- services.yaml is for bwalarm but services registered to alarm_control_panel: how to resolve so their descriptions are picked up?

panel.html
----------
- make an option to have rectangular buttons rather than square
- display "Invalid passcode" if code_to_arm and wrong passcode entered
- timer after clear code/restore persistence is incorrect
- warnings in JS console (about deprecated stuff)
- use another way to find out the integration's entity_id (as someone can change name: in bwalarm.yaml and there is no panel_custom.yaml anymore!)
- service calls: this.platform hardcoded, change
- Beware that html imports are deprecated and support will be removed: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5144752345317376
- enhancement: Enable by User Specific Codes no matter of the toggle state
- _loadData: this.hass.callWS called from non-admin user causes Error handling message: Unauthorized in HA log

Docs:
- add something like this about use cases: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/bwalarm-akasma74-edition/113666/222
- Video tutorial(s) that cover:
    some overall things; set pin code, how arm away/home works, show numpad on “frontend”/lovelace
    how motion sensors are handled (delay, trigger etc)
    how the motion sensors trigger a siren (when armed)
    how the motion sensors trigger a email or/and a notification when triggered)
    -reset alarm after it has been triggered

FRs:

- Is there a way to increase the keypad button size to approximately what it was in the “pre mwc-button”
- If we could get that override open sensors into the lovelace platform that would be amazing
- hide_sensor_groups: True **#[OPTIONAL, Boolean] - False by default. Setting this to True hides sensor groups (all sensors, immediate sensors, delayed sensors, inactive sensors) from the display. Open sensors will still appear**
